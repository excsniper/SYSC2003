<H1>Parallel Ports</H1>

<P>These ports have check boxes for pins programmed as inputs and display boxes for pins programmed as outputs. Outputs are
not updated while simulations are running, however inputs are active when simulations are running via the "Go" or "Step
Over" buttons.</P>

<p>The ports displayed depend on the processor operating mode, with ports J and H being
generally available, port D added for Narrow Memory mode, and ports A and B additionally
added for Single Chip mode. In the case of the 68HC912B32, only ports A and B are provided.</p>
<p>When the Log Changes box is checked, any changes to the outputs
are logged, giving their time (in E/P clocks) and new value. The
logging line looks like this:</P>
<PRE>PORTH,10022,34,22</PRE>

<P>Where <EM>PORTH</EM> is the event name (Port H output changed), <EM>10022</EM>
is the time, <EM>34 </EM>is the value in decimal, and <EM>22</EM> is the value in
hexadecimal.</P>

<P>When the key wakeup interrupt feature is used, the interrupts are edge sensitive and won't be captured until the next P-clock.
Key wakeup on port D uses the same interrupt as the External interrupt pin.</P>
