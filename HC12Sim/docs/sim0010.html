<P><img src="ints.gif" width="73" height="130" align=right >Check boxes are provided for the three external interrupt sources, RESET, XIRQ, and IRQ.
When the interrupt is handled, the check is cleared. Boxes can be checked while simulations are
running via "Go". The checks will be cleared as soon as the interrupt is request is serviced, even
while running via "Go".</P>

<P>Then value given as <EM>pending</EM> are the number of interrupt sources that are requesting service.</P>

assumed and the simulation stops.</P>
